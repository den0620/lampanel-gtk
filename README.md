# Time bounds (WHEN DONE????)
~~Never? Idk I realised I dont like GTK~~
Ok, I can say GTK is actually not that bad after I saw C++

# Building & Running
As install.sh script is now available you can just run it:
```./install.sh```
and binary should be available in ./build
If permission denied do:
```chmod +x ./install.sh```
